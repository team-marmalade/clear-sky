ClearSky is a web app for displaying real-time air quality information. It allows you to store a list of favourites, so you can quickly monitor the air quality accross your frequently vistied locations. ClearSky does not require an account, and was designed to get out of your way, providing a quick and effective way to see how air quality might be affecting your health during the day.

Air quality is one of the biggest silent killers, and we hope that this app might help those with respiratory conditions living in high-risk areas.
